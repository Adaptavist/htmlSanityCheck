*Ralf D. MÃ¼ller* is a Solutions Architect and an ambitious Grails developer.
He is continually trying to simplify his work. Currently, his main concern is
improving the holistic documentation of projects. He achieves this especially with
the help of the arc42 template and docs-as-code approach.

Ralf founded the open source https://docs-as-co.de[docToolchain] project.

*Patrick Double* contributed numerous code patches to htmlSanityCheck, and helped
to keep things going during some dark phases. Thanx, Pat!

Thanx to all the other contributors!
