== Deployment View
Sanity checker will:

1. be bundled as a single jar.
2. be uploaded to a public repository (MavenCentral, JCenter, Bintray or similar),
referencable within a gradle buildfile.
3. provide a +main+ method with parameters and options, so all checks can be
called from the command line.
