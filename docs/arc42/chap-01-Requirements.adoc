== Introduction and Goals


[[requirements]]
=== Requirements Overview

==== Basic Usage

. A user configures the location (directory and filename) of an HTML file,
. and the corresponding images directory.
. kbd:[HtmlSC] performs various checks on the HTML and
. reports its results either on the console or as file.

kbd:[HtmlSC] can run from the command line or as {gradle-url}-plugin.

[[Terminology]]
==== Terminology: What Can Go Wrong in HTML Files?

Severe errors:

. Cross-references (internal links) can be broken, e.g. due to missing or misspelled link-target.
  See <<BrokenCrossReferencesChecker>>
. Referenced image files can be missing or misspelled.
. Links can have multiple identical link-targets (several id attributes with the same name)
. External links can be broken - due to myriads of reasons: misspelled, link-target currently offline,
 illegal link syntax

Flaws:

. Images missing an alt-attribute

=== Quality Goals

[options="header", cols="1,2,6"]
.Quality-Goals
|===
| Priority | Quality-Goal | Scenario
| 1        | Correctness  | Every broken internal link is found.
| 1        | Correctness  | Every missing local image is found.
| 2        | Flexibility  | multiple checking algorithms, report formats and clients. At least
Gradle, command-line and a graphical client have to be supported.
| 2        | Safety       | Content of the files to be checked is _never_ altered.
| 3        | Performance  | Check of 100kB html file performed under 10 secs
(excluding gradle startup)
