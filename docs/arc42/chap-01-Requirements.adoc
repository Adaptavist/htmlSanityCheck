=== Quality Goals

.Quality-Goals
|===
| Priority | Quality-Goal | Scenario
| 1        | Correctness  | Every broken internal link is found.
| 1        | Correctness  | Every missing local image is found.
| 2        | Flexibility  | multiple checking algorithms, report formats and clients. At least
Gradle, command-line and a graphical client have to be supported.
| 2        | Safety       | Content of the files to be checked is _never_ altered.
| 3        | Performance  | Check of 100kB html file performed under 10 secs
(excluding gradle startup)
