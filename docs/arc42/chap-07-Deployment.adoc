The three nodes (_computers_) shown in <<img-deployment>> are connected via public internet.

Sanity checker will:

1. be bundled as a single jar.
2. be uploaded to the Bintray repository, 
3. referencable within a gradle buildfile.
4. provide a +main+ method with parameters and options, so all checks can be
called from the command line.
