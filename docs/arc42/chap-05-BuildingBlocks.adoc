| <<checker_blackbox, CheckerCore>> | core: html parsing and sanity checking, file handling
| HSC Gradle Plugin | integrates the Gradle build tool with kbd:[HtmlSC],
enabling arbitrary gradle builds to use kbd:[HtmlSC] functionality.

| HSC Graphical Interface | (planned, not implemented)

| Reporter
| outputs the collected checking results to configurable
destinations, e.g. StdOut or a html file.

|===
| Interface | Description
| usage via shell | <<arc42_user, arc42 user>> uses a command
line shell to call the kbd:[HtmlSC]
| build system  | currently restricted to Gradle: The build
system uses kbd:[HtmlSC] as configured in the buildscript.
| local-html and local-images | kbd:[HtmlSC] needs access to several
local files, especially the html page to be checked and to the
corresponding image directories.

[[checker_blackbox]]
==== _CheckerCore_ (Blackbox)

Intent/Responsibility:: Checker contains the core functions
to perform the various sanity checks. It parses the html file
into a DOM-like in-memory representation, which is then
used to perform the actual checks.

.CheckerCore building blocks
|===
| Checker
| abstract class, used in form of the template-pattern. Shall be subclassed
for all checking algorithms.

| AllChecksRunner
| Facade to the different Checker instances. Provides a (parameter-driven)
command-line interface.

| ResultsCollector
| Collects all checking results.

| HtmlParser
| Encapsulates html parsing, provides methods to search
within the (parsed) html.

==== Checker and xyzChecker Subclasses

The abstract Checker provides a uniform interface (public void check())
to different checking algorithms. It is based upon the <<checking-concept,
concept of extensible checking algorithms>>.
