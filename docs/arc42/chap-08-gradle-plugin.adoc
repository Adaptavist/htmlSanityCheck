=== Gradle Plugin Concept and Development
You should definitely read the original
[Gradle User Guide] on custom plugin development.

To enable the <<requirements, required Gradle integration>>,
we implement a lean wrapper as described in the Gradle user guide.

[source, groovy]
  class HtmlSanityCheckPlugin implements Plugin<Project> {
      void apply(Project project) {
          project.task('htmlSanityCheck',
                  type: HtmlSanityCheckTask,
                  group: 'Check')
      }
  }

<1> the actual plugin code: HtmlSanityCheckPlugin and
HtmlSanityCheckTask groovy files
<2> Gradle expects plugin properties in META-INF
<3> Property file containing the name of the actual implementation class:

 implementation-class=org.aim42.htmlsanitycheck.HtmlSanityCheckPlugin


==== Building the Plugin
The plugin code itself is built with gradle
